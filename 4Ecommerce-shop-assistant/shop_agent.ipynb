        "### What are Generative Recommendations?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generative Recommendation enables AI to do more than just match user queries to products. It can interpret the user's intent, conduct external research, and generate new, relevant search queries or suggestions based on context and deeper understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key features include:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understanding and Expanding User Intent:**  \n",
        "   The AI can infer the user's underlying needs. For example, if someone asks for a \"birthday present for a 10-year-old boy,\" the system doesn't just search for those exact words.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Using External Research (Google Search):**  \n",
        "   The AI leverages tools like Google Search to research what items are typically bought for a given purpose, such as popular gifts for 10-year-old boys.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generating New Queries:**  \n",
        "   Based on its research, the AI creates a list of more specific and varied search queries, such as \"educational toys for 10-year-olds,\" \"adventure books for boys,\" or \"coding kits for kids,\" to broaden and refine the search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, Generative Recommendation goes beyond simple keyword matching. It proactively helps users discover products by generating new ideas and relevant search paths.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Workflow Overview:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent system you’ll build follows this process:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The user asks the Shop Agent for a recommendation.\n",
        "2. The Shop Agent consults the Research Agent.\n",
        "3. The Research Agent uses Google Search to gather information and generates several targeted queries.\n",
        "4. The Shop Agent presents these queries to the user for approval.\n",
        "5. Upon approval, the Shop Agent uses the queries to search for items via the Vector Search backend.\n",
        "6. The results are returned to the user, completing the recommendation cycle.\n",
